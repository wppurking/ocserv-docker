#  This indicates that all connecting users must present a certificate.

# by auto-select-group option, in order to select the minimum valid group ID.
#
# plain[passwd=/etc/ocserv/ocpasswd,otp=/etc/ocserv/users.otp]
#  The plain option requires specifying a password file which contains
# entries of the following format.
# "username:groupname1,groupname2:encoded-password"
# One entry must be listed per line, and 'ocpasswd' should be used
# to generate password entries. The 'otp' suboption allows to specify
# an oath password file to be used for one time passwords; the format of
# the file is described in https://code.google.com/p/mod-authn-otp/wiki/UsersFile
#
# radius[config=/etc/radiusclient/radiusclient.conf,groupconfig=true,nas-identifier=name,override-interim-updates=false]:
#  The radius option requires specifying freeradius-client configuration
# file. If the groupconfig option is set, then config-per-user will be overriden,
# and all configuration will be read from radius. The 'override-interim-updates' if set to
# true will ignore Acct-Interim-Interval from the server and 'stats-report-time' will be considered.
#
# gssapi[keytab=/etc/key.tab,require-local-user-map=true,tgt-freshness-time=900]
#  The gssapi option allows to use authentication methods supported by GSSAPI,
# such as Kerberos tickets with ocserv. It should be best used as an alternative
# to PAM (i.e., have pam in auth and gssapi in enable-auth), to allow users with
# tickets and without tickets to login. The default value for require-local-user-map
# is true. The 'tgt-freshness-time' if set, it would require the TGT tickets presented
# to have been issued within the provided number of seconds. That option is used to
# restrict logins even if the KDC provides long time TGT tickets.

# If set, the script /usr/bin/ocserv-fw will be called to restrict
# the user to its allowed routes and prevent him from accessing
# any other routes. In case of defaultroute, the no-routes are restricted.
# All the routes applied by ocserv can be reverted using /usr/bin/ocserv-fw
# --removeall. This option can be set globally or in the per-user configuration.

# This option implies restrict-user-to-routes set to true. If set, the

# access specific ports in the network. This option can be set globally
# or in the per-user configuration.

# connecting clients except for the ones offering them. This option

# Groups that a client is allowed to select from.
# A client may belong in multiple groups, and in certain use-cases
# it is needed to switch between them. For these cases the client can
# select prior to authentication. Add multiple entries for multiple groups.
# The group may be followed by a user-friendly name in brackets.

# Configuration files that will be applied per user connection or
# per group. Each file name on these directories must match the username
# or the groupname.
# The options allowed in the configuration files are dns, nbns,

#
# Note that the 'iroute' option allows to add routes on the server
# based on a user or group. The syntax depends on the input accepted
# by the commands route-add-cmd and route-del-cmd (see below). The no-udp
# is a boolean option (e.g., no-udp = true), and will prevent a UDP session
# for that specific user or group. The hostname option will set a
# hostname to override any proposed by the user. Note also, that, any 
# routes, no-routes, DNS or NBNS servers present will overwrite the global ones.

# The system command to use to setup a route. %{R} will be replaced with the

# The following example is from linux systems. %{R} should be something

# KDC server. That is a translation URL between HTTP and Kerberos.

#   EXAMPLE.COM = {
#     kdc = https://ocserv.example.com/KdcProxy

# The following options are for (experimental) AnyConnect client

# This option must be set to true to support legacy CISCO clients.

# That is they may resume a cookie without presenting a certificate
# (when certificate authentication is used).

# Option to allow sending arbitrary custom headers to the client after
